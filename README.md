# Tweet-classification-project

This project aims to build a machine learning classification algorithm to categorize new tweets into one of the following categories: Sports, Politics, Medical, or Entertainment. The dataset contains tweets tagged with these labels, which are used for training and evaluating the model.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Exploration:**

In this step, we explore the structure of the dataset, examine the distribution of the categories, and analyze the content of the tweets. Visualization techniques and summary statistics help to uncover trends and insights that will guide the modeling process.


**Data Preparation:**

Here, we prepare the dataset for modeling. The steps include:

Text cleaning (removing special characters, stopwords, etc.)
Tokenization and text vectorization (converting text into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF)
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Modeling:
In this phase, various classification algorithms are used to train models, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. The goal is to determine which model performs best in classifying tweets into the correct category. Hyperparameter tuning may also be performed to improve performance.


**Model Evaluation:**

The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is applied to ensure that the model generalizes well to new tweets. The best-performing model is then selected for deployment.

**Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure that the following libraries are installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)


**How to Run the Project**

Download or clone the project files from the repository.
Open the project in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.

Follow the steps provided:

- Step 1: Data Exploration

- Step 2: Data Preparation

- Step 3: Data Modeling

Execute the cells or scripts in order to train and evaluate the tweet classification models.

**Future Enhancements**

Experiment with deep learning techniques such as LSTMs or BERT for better classification accuracy.

Explore real-time tweet classification by integrating the model with the Twitter API.

Conduct hyperparameter tuning to further improve model performance.


**Conclusion**

By completing this project, you'll build a robust classifier capable of categorizing new tweets into relevant topics. This demonstrates the full pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation.
